    Multi-Scale discriminator made up of several Patch-GAN discriminators, that process the images
    up to different spatial scales.

    Args:
        num_d: number of discriminators
        num_layers_d: number of Convolution layers (Conv + activation + normalisation + [dropout]) in each
        of the discriminators. In each layer, the number of channels are doubled and the spatial size is
        divided by 2.
        spatial_dims: number of spatial dimensions (1D, 2D etc.)
        num_channels: number of filters in the first convolutional layer (double of the value is taken from then on)
        in_channels: number of input channels
        out_channels: number of output channels in each discriminator
        kernel_size: kernel size of the convolution layers
        activation: activation layer type
        norm: normalisation type
        bias: introduction of layer bias
        dropout: proportion of dropout applied, defaults to 0.
        minimum_size_im: minimum spatial size of the input image. Introduced to make sure the architecture
        requested isn't going to downsample the input image beyond value of 1.
