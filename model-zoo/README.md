# Generative Models - Model Zoo

In this directory, we include the prototypes of the model zoo for the MONAI Generative Models project.
Different from the official one, we do not include all features from the [official one](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/model-zoo).
For this reason, it is not possible to download the models directly with the `python -m monai.bundle run ...` command.
In order to use our models, please, manually download them with their link specified in the `large_files.yml` files,
and place them inside the folder path specified in the same .yml file.
